<th:block th:fragment="whatYouShouldKnow">
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Social Security Numbers</h3>
  You must give us a social security number for each family member who wants benefits.
  If a person who wants benefits does not have a social security number, that person must apply for
  a number. We can help applicants get their numbers.
  If a family member has applied for a social security number, we will not delay your application
  while you wait for the number.
  We use social security numbers to prove income. We do not give numbers to other agencies like
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Citizenship and Immigration Status</h3>
  You must tell us about the citizenship and immigration status for each family member who wants
  benefits.
  Maryland uses the Systematic Alien Verification and Eligibility or SAVE system through the United
  States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) formerly known as Immigration and
  Naturalization Service (INS) to verify the alien status of all applicant and recipient non-citizen
  households. Information received from USCIS may affect your household’s eligibility and benefit
  amount.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Information</h3>
  If a family member will not tell us about citizenship, immigration status or social security
  number, that person will not get benefits.
  They must still give us proof of income, expenses and other things.
  The other family members who give us their information will get benefits if they meet the rules.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Emergency Medical Assistance</h3>
  Immigrants who are not eligible for other kinds of medical assistance and apply only for emergency
  medical assistance do not have to tell us their social security number, immigration or citizenship
  status.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Time Limits</h3>
  Temporary Cash Assistance has time limits.
  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly Food Supplement Program) and Medical
  Assistance do not have a time limit.
  When Temporary Cash Assistance ends because of time limits, earnings or other reasons, you may
  still get SNAP benefits and Medical Assistance.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Interviews</h3>
  You, a responsible family member or someone you choose to represent you must be interviewed.
  In most cases we can interview you by telephone.
  You must give or send us the proof we ask for at your interview.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>If you need help</h3>
  If you need help, applying for benefits, or have questions, or need translations services, call
  your case manager or call 1-800-332-6347.
  Si necesita ayuda para llenar el formulario favor de llamar al 1-800-332-6347.

    accommodation
    may be made in person, in writing or over the telephone. There are no particular words that you
    need to use to request an accommodation. A request may be made by you or someone helping you. If
    you need to request a reasonable accommodation because of your disability, you should speak with
    the case manager or the supervisor or the Customer.

  <h3 class=”text--small”>Right to Written Notice</h3>
  We must always give you a written notice explaining your benefits when we approve your case. We
  must always give you written notice when we change your benefits, deny or close your case. You
  have 90 days from the notice date to ask for a hearing. If you ask for a hearing within 10 days,
  you may be able to keep getting benefits while you wait for the hearing.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Right to Appeal</h3>
  Ask for a hearing if you disagree with the Department’s decision. Your case manager can help you
  write your appeal. At the hearing, you can speak for yourself or bring a lawyer, friend or
  relative to speak for you.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Right to Privacy</h3>
  You are giving personal information in the application. We use the information to see if you are
  eligible for benefits. If you do not give the information, we may deny your application. You have
  a right to review, change, or correct any information. We will not show your information or give
  it to others unless you give us permission or federal and state law allows us to do so.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Right to Claim Good Cause</h3>
  If you want Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA), you must help the Department get child support. You
  may not have to help if it puts you or your family in danger.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Right to Refuse Help</h3>
  You do not have to accept help from a religious organization if it is against your religious
  beliefs.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Right to Timely Application Processing</h3>
  If you are eligible for expedited Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits we
  must give you your benefits within 7 days. For the regular SNAP and other programs, except for
  certain Medical Assistance programs, we must process your application within 30 days. There are
  times when there is a delay in processing. If there is a delay, we will send you a letter to tell
  you why there is delay in processing your application. If you are incarcerated or in another such
  institution and file an application for SNAP benefits or cash assistance, you may not receive SNAP
  or cash benefits until you are released. The filing date of your application for assistance will
  be the date of your release from the institution, if it is less than 30 days from the date your
  signed application was received in the Local Department of Social Services (LDSS). SNAP benefits
  are issued from the date of your release based upon your application date.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Authorization to Receive Family Planning Information</h3>

<th:block th:fragment="yourResponsibilities">
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Provide Information</h3>
  You must give true and complete information. You may need to give us proof of this information. We
  will keep this information private. Any delay in providing proof may result in your case being
  delayed or denied.
  Collecting application information, including the social security number of each household member,
  is authorized under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, U.S.C.2011-2036, Social Security Act
  §1137(f) and 42 U.S.C. §1320b-7(d). We use the information to find out if your household is
  eligible.
  We check this information by matching computer programs.
  We also use the information to see if you meet program rules. We may contact your employer, bank
  or other party. We may also contact local, state or federal agencies to make sure the information
  is correct. We can give your information to other federal or state agencies for official use and
  to law enforcement officers who need it to find persons fleeing to avoid the law.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>If you get too much in benefits:</h3>
  You may have to repay the money for the benefits, and
  We may give the application information, including social security numbers, to federal or state
  agencies, as well as private claims collections agencies, for action.
  Giving information is voluntary. If you do not give us information such as social security numbers
  for everyone who wants help, we may deny benefits for each person who does not give a social
  security number. If you do not have a social security number, we will help you get one.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Report Changes</h3>
  You must report all changes within 10 days unless you are part of the SNAP simplified reporting
  group and are not receiving Cash Assistance or Medical Assistance. If you want to know if you are
  part of this group, ask your case manager. You may tell us about any changes in person, by
  telephone, or by mail to the Department.
  Note: For all SNAP customers including those who are simplified reporters:
  If you receive lottery/gambling winnings in the amount equal or greater than $3,500, you must
  report the amount and the date the winnings received to the local department within 10 days
  If you are an Able Bodies Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD), if your work hours decrease below 80
  hours per month, you must report the change to the Local Department within 10 days.
  <h3 class=”text--small”>Warning</h3>
  We may deny, lower or stop your benefits if you give us wrong information or do not report
  changes. A judge may fine and/or imprison you if you deliberately give wrong information or do not
  report changes.

    unemployment benefits, self-employed- working a minimum of 30 hours or more per week at the
    equivalent of federal minimum wage, attending a recognized school or institution of higher
    education at least half time, or the individual is mentally or physically unfit for work. Work
    registration is not the same as participation.

  pay back any amount you are overpaid.
  If your authorized representative knowingly gives us the wrong information or does not use your
  benefits properly, we may disqualify the person from being an authorized representative and
  prosecute them for fraud under state and federal law.
  If a drug and alcohol treatment center or a group living arrangement acts as your authorized

  I understand that it is important to give true information and if I do not, I am breaking the law.
  I understand that I can be fined, imprisoned or have my benefits reduced for making false
  statements or for pretending to be another person.
  I know I can be punished for not reporting changes that may affect my eligibility or benefit
  amount.
  I understand that if I get more SNAP benefits than I should, all adult members of my household are
  liable for repaying the debt.
  I know the Department can use the application against me in a court of law for fraud prosecution.
  I know that failing to report or verify shelter, medical or dependent care expenses or child
  support payments is the same as saying I do not want a deduction for the expenses I did not verify
  or report.
  I understand that the Department may check the information on this form to see if it is correct
  and may select my case for a spot check, such as for a Quality Control Review.
  I agree to allow someone from the Department to visit me at home. I will help them get all needed
  proofs from any source.
  I understand by signing this application:
  <ul class=”text--small”>
    <li>I accept cash assistance and/or medical assistance.</li>
    <li>I agree that Medicare Part B will make payments directly to doctors and medical suppliers.
    </li>
    <li>I give the Department the right to seek payment from private or public health insurance and
      any liable third party. I understand that I must cooperate with the department in securing
      such payments. The Department may seek payment without legal action, as long as it does not
      keep more than the amount Medical Assistance paid.

  I understand that when a person is deceased who was at least 55 years old when receiving Medical
  Assistance, the state may take money from the estate to repay payments made on behalf of that
  person.
  The program may take the money only if there is no surviving spouse, unmarried child younger than
  21, or blind or disabled child (married or unmarried) of any age.
  I understand that, as required by Maryland law, certain law enforcement agencies that investigate
  fraud can obtain information about my application, income, benefits and other documentation as
  part of their investigation. While access to my application and benefit information is normally
  limited (under Md. Code Ann. Human Services Article § 1-201), these limits do not apply to these
  investigative agencies. Such agencies include the Department of Human Services’ Office of the
  Inspector General. I understand that I do not need to provide consent to these agencies in order
  for them to investigate any allegations of fraud against me. Any information found as a result of
  the investigation may be used against me if an allegation of fraud is prosecuted.
